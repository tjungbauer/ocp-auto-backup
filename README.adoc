## Helm Chart: ocp-auto-backup

This very basic Helm chart creates a CronJob in OpenShift, mounts a volume and performs a ETCD backup of the cluster. 

### Installing
I create the namespace via the templates, because it was initially created to be used with Gitops

----
helm install ocp-auto-backup .
----

### Template

----
helm template .
