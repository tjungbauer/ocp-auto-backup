## Helm Chart: ocp-auto-backup

This very basic Helm chart creates a CronJob in OpenShift, mounts a volume and performs a ETCD backup of the cluster. 

Be sure to verify the values.yaml, especially the settings for the PVC.
Also review the backup command, currently the backups, older than 30 days, are removed. 

CAUTION: No warranty, be sure the backup works, disk is available and restore process is known and tested.

### Installing
I create the namespace via the templates, because it was initially created to be used with Gitops

----
helm install ocp-auto-backup .

### Template
